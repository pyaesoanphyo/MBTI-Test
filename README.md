# MBTI Test Model

![MBTI](MBTI)
## Introduction

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a popular personality assessment tool used to understand individual differences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. This test model is a Python implementation of the MBTI test, allowing users to answer a series of questions to determine their dominant personality type.

## Implementation Details

The MBTI test model is implemented in Python using a combination of arrays, dictionaries, and user input. Here's a brief overview of the implementation:

- **MBTI Types Array**: Defines an array containing information about different MBTI personality types including their type code, description, strengths, weaknesses, recommended careers, and category.

- **MBTI Test Function**: Implements a function called `mbti_test()` that presents a series of questions to the user, collects their responses, and calculates scores for each personality type based on the responses.

- **Point System**: Defines a point system that assigns different weights to each response option (a, b, c, d) for each MBTI type.

- **Result Display**: Determines the dominant personality type based on the accumulated scores and displays the result along with associated information such as strengths, weaknesses, recommended careers, and category.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the Python script containing the MBTI test model.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. Answer the series of questions presented by the script by selecting the most appropriate response option (a, b, c, or d) for each question.
4. Once all questions are answered, the script will calculate the scores for each personality type and determine the dominant personality type.
5. The result will be displayed, showing the dominant personality type along with its associated strengths, weaknesses, recommended careers, and category.
